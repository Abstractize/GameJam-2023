# 🪐 Ausländer – Global Game Jam 2023

**Ausländer** is a multiplayer simulation game developed during the [Global Game Jam 2023](https://v3.globalgamejam.org/2023/games/ausländer-8), inspired by children's MMOs like *Club Penguin*. In this world, animals have been exposed to a toxic environment, and your mission is to take care of them, feed them, and help them return to their roots.

> "In Ausländer the animals were exposed to a toxic environment. You can save them by buying groceries to improve their stats and return them to their ROOTS."
